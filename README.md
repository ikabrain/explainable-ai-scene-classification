# Explainable AI: Scene Classification and GradCam Visualization 

This project involves training a deep learning model to predict the type of scenery in images. In addition, we are going to use a technique known as Grad-Cam to help explain how AI models think. This could be practically used for detecting the type of scenery from the satellite images.
